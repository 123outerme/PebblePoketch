# PebblePoketch - Counter
Pokemon Platinum Poketch apps on Pebble Smartwatches.

This is the the Counter app, which simply increments from 0 to 9999 (wrapping around after hitting 9999) by pressing a button. This is not really a helpful app, but the original version brought me a lot of joy when I was messing around on my DS, not really playing the game. It's actually helpful now, though, since it's a simple app to design, helping me learn the basics of Pebble development and increasing my C knowledge.

If you're interested in Pebble C development, I highly recommend using [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.net). It's a very awesome browser IDE including a C editor, compilor, and Pebble emulator. It isn't perfect, but it's as close as humanity can get to perfection. I use it myself, and look what I made, right?
