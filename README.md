Pokemon Platinum Poketch apps on Pebble Smartwatches.
Pokemon Platinum used the Touch Screen of the DS to bring a cute way to monitor real-world time, as well as provide other helpful or not-so-helpful services, like looking at your Pokemon team, testing a Pokemon's happiness, testing attack effectiveness, etc. Some of these apps were really fun to mess around with, and so as I have a Pebble, I want to replicate some of these apps.

So far, I have the Counter app, which simply increments from 0 to 9999 (wrapping around after hitting 9999) by pressing a button. This is not really a helpful app, but it brought me a lot of joy when I was messing around on my DS, not really playing the game. It's actually helpful now, though, since it's a simple app to design, helping me learn the basics of Pebble development and increasing my C knowledge.
