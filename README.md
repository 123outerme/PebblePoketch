# PebblePoketch
Pokemon Platinum Poketch apps on Pebble Smartwatches.

Pokemon Platinum used the Touch Screen of the DS to bring a cute way to monitor real-world time, as well as provide other helpful or not-so-helpful services, like looking at your Pokemon team, testing a Pokemon's happiness, testing attack effectiveness, etc. Some of these apps were really fun to mess around with, and so as I have a Pebble, I want to replicate some of these apps.

If you're interested in Pebble C development, I highly recommend using [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.net). It's a very awesome browser IDE including a C editor, compilor, and Pebble emulator. It isn't perfect, but it's as close as humanity can get to perfection. I use it myself, and look what I made, right?
